/**
 * The {@link ContainerEventProcessor} is a sub-service running in a Segment Container that aims at providing a durable,
 * FIFO-like queue abstraction over an internal, system-critical Segment. The {@link ContainerEventProcessor} service
 * can manage one or more {@link EventProcessor}s, which are the ones that append events to the queue and handle events
 * read. The {@link ContainerEventProcessor} tails each of the Segments registered for each {@link EventProcessor}. When
 * it has at least 1 Event to read on an {@link EventProcessor}'s Segment, it invokes its handler. If there are multiple
 * events available, up to {@link EventProcessorConfig#getMaxItemsAtOnce()} should be used as input for the handler.
 *
 * If the handler completes normally, the items will be removed from the queue (i.e., the {@link EventProcessor}'s
 * Segment will be truncated up to that offset). If the handler completes with an exception, the items will not be
 * removed; we will retry indefinitely. It is up to the consumer to handle any exceptions; any exceptions that bubble up
 * to us will be considered re-triable (except {@link DataCorruptionException}, etc.).
